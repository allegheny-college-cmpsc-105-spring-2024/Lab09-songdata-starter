# Tableau Public

This lab is about explore song meta data in Tableau Public.
In the end, you will have a multipanel data graphic with
text annotations that will be publically available. The
graphic should ideally tell a complete story using words
when necessary, but primarily images.

## TODOs preliminary

- in github or using any software you are familiar with,
  look at the data in assets/data/song_data.csv
- look at the data variable names, and think about what variables
  may be correlated.
- examine the
  [kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/song-popularity-dataset)
  and the distribution plots for each variable to generate ideas
- write down a hypothesis and why you have hypothesized it
- identify the variables that are discrete, continuous, categorical
- modify your hypothesis to incorporate an additional exploration
  of correlations as filtered by a categorical or discrete variable
- Example: Danceability and liveness are likely correlated, but only for fast tempos
- If your hypothesis requires, add a data variable that codes what you need.
  In the given example, it would be helpful to add a variable that indicates if tempo
  is fast or slow. 


## TODOs for Tableau Public

- open tableau public
- import the data from assets/data/song_data.csv (drag and drop)
- make figures in different sheets by dragging variables into rows and columns
- make at least four sheets (four figures) that explain the thought
  process you followed to the answer to your question/address your hypothesis.
- make sure that the at least one figure shows the filtered data (e.g. split up by tempo)
- add trend lines to the data 
- add the sheets together into a dashboard


## TODOs for making a complete data graphic

- add text annotation to describe your hypothesis
- add text annotations on the dashboard to describe every figure
- add text annotations to explain the variables used
- creating any necessary headings for title, initial observations, analysis, results
- display the trend line statistics and explain what they mean
- reference any other
  [tableau public data graphics](https://www.tableau.com/viz-gallery) to borrow
  storytelling ideas
- make your story as clear as possible

## TODOs for submitting your work

- add a link to your graphic following this example
- [Emily Graber](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emily.graber/viz/Book1_17127641017740/Story1)
- ensure that the graphic is visible outside of your account by
  having a colleague follow the link
- push this README with the link back to github before the deadline
